# Transferability of spectral Graph Neural Networks 

This private repository regroups the efforts to be able to study the transferability of graph neural networks by learning a laplacian transformation

## Python Files:

* None for the moment

## Support Notebooks
Notebooks made to visualise, measure of develop different scripts.
