# Transferability of spectral Graph Neural Networks 

This private repository regroups the efforts to be able to study the transferability of graph neural networks by learning a laplacian transformation

## Python Files:

* Dataset.py - torch dataset definition
* model.py - torch implementation of the Chebnet
* utils.py - utility functions
* laplacian.py - Group all functions linked with laplacian calculation
* graphs.py - Group all graph generation functions

## Support Notebooks
Notebooks made to visualise, measure of develop different scripts.
